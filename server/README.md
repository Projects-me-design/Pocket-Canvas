# Pocket-Canvas Server

Copyright © 2026 project-tech-me · project-tech-me@protonmail.com · MIT licence

Run your own server to:

- **keep your boards the same on all your devices** without a sync folder (computers, Android, iPhone and iPad), and
- **share boards with other people** and edit them together. Everyone sees each other's changes in about a second, plus who else is on the board and which card they're working on.

Nothing goes through anyone else's computers. The server is one small Node.js program with one dependency, and everything is kept in a single folder.

## 1. How it works

- **Accounts.** Anyone who knows the server's **join code** can create an account (a name and a password). After that, they sign in with their own password. Each device gets its own sign-in key, which can be signed out.
- **Your boards.** Each of your devices sends its copy of your boards to the server, which passes it to your other devices. It also keeps the latest copy from each device, so a device that was off catches up when it connects. Devices combine copies card by card, the same way folder sync does: different changes are all kept, and for the same card the latest change wins.
- **Shared boards.** When you share a board, that board and the boards inside it are sent to the people you choose, and their changes come back. Your other boards are never sent to them.
- **Pictures and files** are uploaded once, under their random id.
- **Password-protected boards** stay encrypted on the server (as in folder sync). They can't be shared.

## 2. What you need

- A machine that stays on: for example a Proxmox VM or container, a Raspberry Pi, a NAS that runs Docker, or a small cloud server.
- **To use it away from home, or share with people outside your home:**
  - a domain name, which can be a free one from a service such as DuckDNS
  - ports **80** and **443** forwarded from your router to the machine
- **For home use only:** nothing else. See [option C](#5-option-c-home-network-only).

## 3. Option A: Docker with automatic HTTPS (recommended)

The `docker-compose.yml` in this folder runs the server behind **Caddy**, which gets and renews an HTTPS certificate for you.

1. **Make a machine with Docker.** On Proxmox, a small Debian or Ubuntu VM is enough (1 CPU, 1 GB of memory, 10 GB of disk). Then install Docker:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
   ```

2. **Copy this `server` folder** onto it, for example to `/opt/pocket-canvas-server`.
3. **Point your domain name at your home's internet address.** Forward ports 80 and 443 on your router to this machine.
4. **Edit two files** in the folder:
   - `Caddyfile`: replace `boards.example.com` with your domain name.
   - `docker-compose.yml`: replace `change-me-to-something-secret` with your **join code**. Choose something hard to guess; anyone with it can make an account.
5. **Start it:**

   ```bash
   cd /opt/pocket-canvas-server
   docker compose up -d
   docker compose logs -f pocket-canvas      # Ctrl+C to stop watching
   ```

6. **Check it.** Open `https://your-domain/health` in a web browser. It should show `{"app":"Pocket-Canvas Server",…}`.

Everything is kept in `./data` next to the compose file; that's the folder to back up.

## 4. Option B: a Proxmox container without Docker

1. In Proxmox, create a **Debian 12** container (LXC) with 1 CPU, 512 MB of memory and 8 GB of disk.
2. Inside it:

   ```bash
   apt update && apt install -y nodejs npm
   mkdir -p /opt/pocket-canvas-server && cd /opt/pocket-canvas-server
   # copy pocket-canvas-server.js and package.json here, then:
   npm install --omit=dev
   ```

   Debian 12's Node.js is version 18, which works. For a newer version, use NodeSource.
3. **Run it as a service.** Create `/etc/systemd/system/pocket-canvas.service`:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Pocket-Canvas Server
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   WorkingDirectory=/opt/pocket-canvas-server
   Environment=JOIN_CODE=change-me-to-something-secret
   Environment=DATA_DIR=/var/lib/pocket-canvas
   Environment=PORT=8787
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/node pocket-canvas-server.js
   Restart=always
   DynamicUser=yes
   StateDirectory=pocket-canvas

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

4. Start it:

   ```bash
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl enable --now pocket-canvas
   journalctl -u pocket-canvas -f
   ```

5. **For use from outside your home**, put HTTPS in front of it, for example with Caddy in the same container:

   ```bash
   apt install -y caddy
   echo 'boards.example.com {
     reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8787
   }' > /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
   systemctl reload caddy
   ```

   Then forward ports 80 and 443 to the container.

## 5. Option C: home network only

If everyone using it is on your home network, you can skip the domain name and HTTPS. Run the server (option A without Caddy, or option B) and use the address `http://<the machine's IP address>:8787` in Pocket-Canvas.

Over plain `http://`, your boards travel across your home network unencrypted. Only do this on a network you trust, and never forward port 8787 from your router.

The apps allow plain `http://` addresses for this:
- **Android and the desktop app** accept them.
- **iPhone and iPad** accept them only for local network addresses.

## 6. Signing in from Pocket-Canvas

On each device, open **Settings › Server** (on Android, iPhone and iPad: **⋮ › Settings › Server**).

1. Type the **server address**, for example `https://boards.example.com`.
2. **The first time**, type a name, a password (8 characters or more) and the **join code**, then click **Create account**.
3. **On your other devices**, type the same name and password and click **Sign in**. You don't need the join code again.
4. The top bar shows **● Live** while connected.

**Keep all my boards in step through this server** is on by default. You can use it instead of a sync folder or alongside one.

## 7. Sharing a board

1. Right-click a board (on its card, or in the sidebar) and choose **Share with people…**. On a touch screen, press and hold instead of right-clicking.
2. Tick the people to share with. They need an account on the same server first.
3. Click **Share**.

They see the board appear on their Home board straight away, with a blue sharing badge. From then on:

- **Changes appear for everyone within about a second.** The coloured initials in the top bar show who else is on the board, and the card they're on is outlined with their name (✎ while they type).
- **If two people change the same card at the same moment**, the later change wins. Different cards never clash.
- **The board's owner** can add or remove people, or **Stop sharing**. Anyone else can **Leave**. Either way, everyone keeps their own copy as it was.
- **Boards with a password can't be shared**, and shared boards can't be given a password.

## 8. Looking after the server

- **Back up** the data folder: `./data` for Docker, `/var/lib/pocket-canvas` for the service in option B. It holds everything: accounts, the latest copy from each device, and pictures and files.
- **Update** to a new version:
  - Docker: copy in the new `pocket-canvas-server.js`, then run `docker compose up -d --build`.
  - Option B: copy it in, then run `systemctl restart pocket-canvas`.
- **Stop new sign-ups** by removing `JOIN_CODE` and restarting. Existing accounts keep working.
- **Remove someone:**
  1. Stop the server.
  2. Delete their entry from `data/users.json`, and their keys from `data/tokens.json` (the entries whose `user` is their id).
  3. Start the server again.
- **Lost password:** there's no reset email. Delete the account as above and make a new one. The person's boards are still on their devices.

## 9. Settings

| Setting (environment variable) | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `JOIN_CODE` | (none: no sign-ups) | Code needed to create an account |
| `PORT` | `8787` | Port to listen on |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Address to listen on (`127.0.0.1` when Caddy is on the same machine) |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Where everything is kept |
| `MAX_ASSET_MB` | `500` | Largest picture, video or file accepted |

## 10. Security notes

- **Passwords** are stored as scrypt hashes, and sign-in keys as SHA-256 hashes. Neither can be read back from the files.
- **Sign-in attempts** are limited to 10 a minute from each address.
- **Use HTTPS for anything outside your home**, or boards and passwords travel unencrypted.
- **On disk, the server's copies aren't encrypted** (except password-protected boards), so protect the machine and its backups.
- **Pictures and files** can be fetched by any signed-in person who knows their id. Ids are random 64-bit numbers that only appear inside boards shared with them.
