# Pocket-Canvas

A desktop app for organising ideas visually, in the style of Milanote: put notes, pictures, links, to-do lists, tables, sketches, audio, video and files on an infinite board, group them in columns, connect them with lines, and nest boards inside boards. Start from templates, sync across your computers, and save from your browser with the companion extension.

Runs on Windows, Linux and macOS. Local-first: no account, no Pocket-Canvas cloud. Your boards stay on your computers.

- **Colour cards** take any colour code or picked colour and **name it automatically**

**New in 1.1**
- **Sync between computers** through Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud, Nextcloud, Syncthing or any synced folder, merging card by card so nothing is overwritten

**Board:** infinite canvas with pan/zoom · drag cards onto boards, the sidebar or breadcrumbs to file them · lines and arrows · colour labels · multi-select · copy/paste between boards · undo/redo · search across everything (including comments) · dark and light themes · Markdown export and JSON backup · autosave with a safety copy

## Guides

- **[User Guide](docs/USER-GUIDE.md)**: installing and using Pocket-Canvas, for everyone
- **[Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md)**: how the code works, testing, building and releasing
- **[Releasing and code signing](docs/RELEASING.md)**: step-by-step guides to publishing a release and signing the installers

## Running it from the source

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Tests (see the [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md#18-testing)):

```bash
npm run test:merge      # sync merge engine (plain Node)
npm test                # core features, real app
npm run test:features   # 1.1 features: sync, export, templates, comments, extension API…
npm run test:extension  # extension in Chromium (needs Playwright)
```

## Building an installer

```bash
npm run dist:win     # Windows installer (.exe)  — run on Windows
npm run dist:linux   # Linux AppImage and .deb
npm run dist:mac     # macOS .dmg                — run on a Mac
```

The installers appear in the `dist` folder.

```bash
npm run extension    # browser extension zip for the add-on stores
```

**Easiest way to get a Windows .exe without setting anything up:** push this project to GitHub. The included workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) builds Windows, Linux and macOS installers automatically. Go to the repo's **Actions** tab → **Build installers** → **Run workflow**, then download the installers from the finished run. Pushing a tag such as `v1.0.0` also attaches them to a GitHub Release.

## Where your data lives

|---------|--------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Pocket-Canvas` |

`pocket-canvas-data.json` holds your boards; the `assets` folder holds images and files you added. *File → Open Data Folder* takes you there. To back everything up, copy that whole folder.

> **Upgrading from PocketCanvas?** The first time Pocket-Canvas starts, it copies your boards, images and files from the old `PocketCanvas` data folder automatically. The old folder is left untouched, so you can delete it once you're happy.
